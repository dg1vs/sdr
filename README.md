# Chaoswelle and SDR 

For the [37C3](https://events.ccc.de/category/37c3/) I prepared a short session about the basic concepts of Software Defined Radio (SDR). This session was held at the [Chaoswelle Assembly](https://chaoswelle.de/Hauptseite) on the third day of the congress as a [self-organized session](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/event/software-defined-radio/). I was quite overwhelmed by the interest in this topic and received a lot of questions.

In order to keep the information available, I was asked to publish the presentation. So the pdf can be found here. If you have any questions or suggestions to improve the presentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

There was also a request for good literature tips. Two links to good books with lots of practical examples
