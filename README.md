# Chaoswelle and SDR 

For the [37C3](https://events.ccc.de/category/37c3/) I prepared a short session about the basic concepts of Software Defined Radio (SDR). This session was held at the [Chaoswelle Assembly](https://chaoswelle.de/Hauptseite) on the third day of the congress as a [self-organized session](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/event/software-defined-radio/). I was quite overwhelmed by the interest in this topic and received a lot of questions.
